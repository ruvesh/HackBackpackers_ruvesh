To find the lineage of a sql query, I have used the sqlparse library. The library is able to parse queries and provide tokens, identifiers, keywords, etc for processing.

With the above approach, I was able to successfully generate the lineage for the simple example query which was provided in the document.

However, this does not work well with the complex queries. The approach would be able to solve it for complex queries as well, but due to time constraints, I wasn't able to optimize it for all the parsing scenarios.

Given a little more time, The approach taken should be able to solve the problem and extend out to all complexities of queries.
