The XML file contains folder tags. Under each folder tag, there are tags for source and target. The target's NAME attribute is linked to the source's DBDNAME attribute.

In case of transformations, there are TRANSFORMATION tags under MAPPING Tags, where the TYPE attribute specifies the TRANSFORMATION TYPE.
The transformations can be mapped with the INSTANCE Tags on the basis of TYPE = "Source Qualifier". This parsing and mapping would be able to reveal the transformations applied to each field.

I have been able to find the source and target mappings programmatically. Due to time constraint, I wasn't able to complete the logic to find all the fields.

This solution can be completed with the above approach with a little more time.
